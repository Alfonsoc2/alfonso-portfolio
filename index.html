    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p><strong>Alfonso Centeno</strong></p>
    <p><em>Bilingual Customer Service Professional | Aspiring Developer | Problem Solver</em></p>
    <p>Hey, I’m Alfonso! Born and raised in Omaha, Nebraska, I’ve always had a strong passion for problem-solving and helping others. Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in customer service and technical support, gaining hands-on experience in fast-paced environments like Nissan and Cox Communications. As a bilingual professional fluent in both English and Spanish, I’m able to bridge communication gaps and provide solutions that truly meet customers' needs.</p>
    <p>Having served as an Assistant Service Manager, I’ve developed a deep appreciation for leadership, team coordination, and operational efficiency. But I’m not stopping there—I’ve decided to take my career to the next level by diving into the world of backend development and AI. I’m passionate about technology’s ability to create meaningful solutions, and I’m currently expanding my skills to build the tools and systems that will help improve how people interact with technology.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I’m always exploring new coding languages and diving into projects that challenge me to grow. Whether I’m working with customer service teams or developing a new AI-driven app, I’m focused on building solutions that make life easier, more efficient, and more connected.</p>
